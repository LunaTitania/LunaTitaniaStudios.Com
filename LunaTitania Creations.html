		<p>Hello! My name is LunaTitania, as of 2024 I am a 25 year old female from Michigan who among other things,enjoys writing and art and is trying to spread my creations like a kudzu vine, being on Archive Of Our Own under the same name, Wattpad under a similar name, and WebNovel under the same name. Recently,I've had a few coding classes(nothing special,just a basic intro to HTML and CSS),so I thought it's about time to try my shot at making a website, so this is it,to practice my skills and maybe get some more views.</p>
		<p>That's about it for now, I'll update when I think of more stuff!</p>
